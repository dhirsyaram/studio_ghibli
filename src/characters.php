                        One day, she escapes to the surface and meets a human boy named Sōsuke. 
                        Through their bond, she wishes to become human, leading to a magical 
                        and emotional journey.

                    <p class="character-description">
                        Sōsuke is a 5-year-old boy who wears a sunshine yellow t-shirt and 
                        chocolate brown shorts, and white slip-on shoes.
                        His hair is walnut brown with his hair shaven underneath.
                        Also, he sometimes wears a sailor hat and binoculars.

                    <p class="character-description">
                        Lisa is bright, cheerful and attentive. She exhibits high emotional intelligence, 
                        and is shown to be quick thinking and competent in high-stress situations. 
                        Due to the scattered nature of their community, Lisa communicates clearly 
                        and directly with her son, Sōsuke, treating him like an equal. 
                        As such, we see that Sōsuke is fluent in Morse code, and knows how to operate their 
                        home's signal lamp to message passing sailors, like his father, Kōichi.

                        Referred to as "Koichi" by Sôsuke and Lisa. 
                        Captain of the cargo ship "Koganei Maru". 
                        He is often away from home because of his work, 
                        but he loves his family dearly.

                        Oceanic wisdom, a love that transcends the human world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="character-description">
                        Granmammare is a sea goddess, capable of changing her humanoid form at will. 
                        She initially appears enormous; possibly as big as, 
                        if not bigger than, a Blue Whale. She appears to others in a bathed glow 
                        with a warm, golden light, possibly produced by luminescent plankton. 
                        She resembles a very beautiful woman with impossibly-long, red hair, 
                        brown eyes, and a kindly face. The cyan robe she wears seems to merge with 
                        the sea when she swims, and it is unknown if she has feet, or simply floats freely when she stands.

                    <p class="character-tagline">
                        A sea sorcerer torn between duty and love.
                    </p>
                    <p class="character-description">
                        Fujimoto is slender and appears to be 40-years old, but he may have lived much longer.
                        He claims he was once human, which implies he underwent some changes in order to become the
                        wizard he is now.
                        This may be a clue as to why he has strange, bird-like markings on his cheekbones and around his
                        eyes.
